A mobile app that simulates projectile motion

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Mobile application completed as part of an assignment for the Mobile Course</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Drag on the screen for direction, speed and height
    <ul>
      <li>The longer the line the faster it will go</li>
      <li>Where you start is the height from the bottom of the phone</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The motion will be drawn based on the path</li>
  <li>Repeat if you would like to go again.</li>
</ol>
